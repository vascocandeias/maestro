# MAESTRO front-end

This repo contains the front-end source code of [MAESTRO (dynaMic bAyESian neTwoRks Online)](https://vascocandeias.github.io/maestro), a website for multivariate time series analysis using dynamic Bayesian networks.

The publicly available website was deployed in AWS, and the relevant code is available [here](https://github.com/vascocandeias/maestro-cloud). You can also find the on-premises back-end code [here](https://github.com/vascocandeias/maestro), which can be used to deploy the website in a managed network. The front-end of the local version [may be easily customised](#changing-the-front-end).

For a more detailed explanation of this architecture, you may read the resulting [article (available soon)](https://github.com/vascocandeias/maestro) or underlying [thesis (available soon)](https://github.com/vascocandeias/maestro).
